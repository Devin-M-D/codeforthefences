Minor bugs and features:
- wire up add buttons for foodVariant and prepStyle
- adding new searchSelect value should automatically select as well
- "bitter marshmallows" creates erroneous div, removing space
- bug adding new prepStyles
- fix shyScroll of searchSelect
- fix stepText boxes
- debounce acceptStepChange (keyup)
- add new ingredient field via searchSelect should select the value
- pages are just components and could probably be consolidated
- css grid
- native js selectors

Big Picture:
- lead cap manager portfolio demo
- budget page
- unit test GUI
