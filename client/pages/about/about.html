<p class="sectionHeader">About Me</p>
<p>
  I'm Devin Downer and I've been a professional code monkey for 15 years with experience across a wide range of technologies and industries. The largest part of my experience is in fullstack web applications in the Microsoft stack of C#/T-SQL, and my favorite tasks are usually ones such as regex, queries and data analysis, and abstracting and generalizing logic for reusability.

<p class="sectionHeader">About the Site</p>
<p>
	This site is too long time in the making. It was concieved as a dogfood productivity suite, and the first feature is a cookbook to be followed by a budget, grocery list, and more. It's the culmination of a lot of experimentation and trying to create enterprise functionality in the spirit of the <a href='https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/'>cleanest and most light-weight that a website</a> can be. Have backend, frontend, and database: will travel.

<p>
	The architectural features I'm most proud of are a componentized front-end pattern using only javascript and JQuery, data normalization with a guiding principal of trying not to let any word or "object" appear in the database twice, a MySQL query builder/ORM pattern with no lock-in, and end-to-end unit testing based on units of user interaction so that testing takes place on real data in a real world context.
