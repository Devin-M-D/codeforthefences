  <p>Hello, welcome to Code for the Fences!</p>
  <p>
    My name is Devin Downer and this site is a somewhat random collection of ideas I've had.
    My original goal was to host my own suite of dogfood tools such as a budget and cookbook.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then I've been distracted by experimenting with architectural patterns, writing a
  componentized front-end library, conceptualizing a fully-decentralized blockchain web app with
  a payload of it's own git repo, brainstorming HTML/JS/CSS games, and various other
  non-demoable endeavors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally I have the foundation I need to create the functionality that makes my own life easier,
    and am excited to have something I'm proud to show off.
  </p>
  <p>
    As of today I consider the existing features to be in development/alpha testing.
